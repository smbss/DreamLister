This app uses CoreData to persistently store user information on their device. Users can add or remove items that they want to buy in the future, along with relevant information about them.  
Besides the item name, price, description and store, users can also add an image from their photo library.  
The items will then be listed in a table view where they can be ordered by price, title or date, with the help of a segmented control.
